<h3>Print By Print</h3>
<p>"When I signed up, I had no idea what I was getting into," admits Alexandra Good '12 as she takes a visitor through Print by Print: From D&uuml;rer to Lichtenstein, the recent Baltimore Museum of Art exhibition curated by the Johns Hopkins and Maryland Institute College of Art students enrolled in Paper Museums: Exhibiting Prints at the BMA.</p>
<p>Turns out that what Good was getting into was life-changing.</p>
<p>As a result of the Paper Museums class, taught by Rena M. Hoisington, associate curator and department head in the Department of Prints, Drawings, and Photographs at the Baltimore Museum of Art, Good has had the opportunity to be a curator, an art historian, and a BMA tour guide. She has written wall labels for exhibitions and been interviewed on the radio. The class also prompted Good, a history of art major with a minor in the Writing Seminars, to complete an additional minor in museums and society. This semester, Good is conducting copyright research through a BMA internship in the museum's Image Services and Rights Department. In the fall, she will attend University of Pittsburgh School of Law and has been accepted in the university's joint degree program in arts management (JD/MAM) with Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College. </p>
<p>All this from a single class? Yes indeed.</p>
<p>With the support of a major grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Hoisington conceived the class as a way to showcase a portion of the BMA's outstanding and expansive print collection, educate visitors to the history of printmaking, and build bridges between the BMA, JHU, and MICA. In the first few weeks, students, nearly half of them with no background in art history, got a crash course in the history of Western prints and printmaking. Throughout the semester, students prepared presentations on a series of prints in the collection. In the last few weeks, they selected works, brainstormed themes, discussed the arrangement of prints, and developed marketing strategies for the exhibition. The semester-long schedule was "really tight for such a large-scale project," admits Hoisington, but the students embraced their task, in the process gaining an intimate knowledge of not only the works themselves but a behind-the-scenes look into how a museum operates that can be, well, life-changing.</p>
<p>Of the many challenges involved with curating an exhibition, the trickiest, says Good, was crafting the 100-word wall labels for each print. When the exhibition opened, she says, "it was weird to see my words on the wall." But it was also pretty wonderful, too.</p>
